            <p>Koda is a 4 years old Corgi. Kodak is also a cute corgi that my best friend and his girlfriend raised together. My firend went to the graduate school in China, so now he's being raised by his girlfriend.</p> 
            <P>Koda the Corgi was a bundle of energy, known for his boundless enthusiasm and short, stubby legs. Every morning, he'd chase sunbeams around the living room, his fluffy tail wagging with pure joy. In the park, Koda's playful antics brought smiles to everyone's faces. His infectious spirit reminded everyone that happiness could be found in the simplest of moments. Koda, with his big, expressive eyes, was more than a pet; he was a source of endless love and laughter in his family's life.</P>
